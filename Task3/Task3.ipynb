    "## Task 3\n",
    "##  General Health Query Chatbot (Prompt Engineering Based) \n",
    "# Objective\n",
    "The objective of this task was to develop an AI-powered health chatbot capable of answering general health-related questions in a safe, friendly, and conversational manner. The chatbot aimed to provide helpful information while avoiding professional medical advice, ensuring responses remained educational and approachable.\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "This task involved creating a command-line based chatbot using the DeepSeek R1 large language model accessed via the OpenRouter API. The chatbot continuously interacted with users until the \"quit\" command was entered. The purpose was to demonstrate the integration of external AI models into a local application, leveraging API calls for real-time, high-quality responses without requiring local model training. Key Python libraries included requests for communication and json for data parsing. Prompt engineering techniques were applied to instruct the AI to return safe, general health information.\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "The chatbot‚Äôs workflow began with setting up the Python environment and installing the requests library using pip install requests. The program used requests.post() to send JSON-formatted requests to the OpenRouter API endpoint, specifying the DeepSeek R1 model and user‚Äôs query. An API key handled authentication, while the \"HTTP-Referer\" and \"X-Title\" headers were optionally included for OpenRouter ranking purposes. The .json() method parsed the API response to extract the chatbot‚Äôs reply, which was displayed in the console. This process ran in a loop, allowing continuous conversation until the user decided to exit. Error handling was added to manage invalid responses, network issues, or other API-related errors. The API approach was chosen for its efficiency, as it allowed the use of an advanced pre-trained model without heavy local computation, ensuring fast and reliable outputs.\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "This task successfully produced a fully functional health chatbot capable of engaging in continuous dialogue with users. It displayed Python, API integration, JSON handling, and conversational AI design. By leveraging the DeepSeek R1 model through the OpenRouter API, the chatbot delivered responsive, safe, and user-friendly interactions."
