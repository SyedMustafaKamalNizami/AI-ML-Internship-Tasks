Task 1 

Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

Objective:

To explore, analyze, and visualize the Iris dataset in order to understand its structure, relationships between features, and patterns that can be useful for classification tasks.

Dataset Used:

Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species).

Models Applied:

No machine learning model applied in this task â€” focused on data exploration and visualization.

Key Results & Findings:


Used pandas for data loading and exploration (.shape, .head(), .info(), .describe()).

Applied matplotlib and seaborn to create scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots.

Observed clear separation between species, especially in petal measurements.

Identified patterns that could be leveraged in classification models.
